        <p id="contentParagraph">Trickster is everywhere, he is in an eternal state of mind. The trickster is present in us as soon as we gain awareness of our ego in our childhood. It is the most primitive progression to the hero myth, but a necessary step towards becoming mature and whole. The totality of life consists of order and chaos, and the spirit of this disorder is the trickster. He is the Dionysian god of wine and music that connects us to instinctual forces that lie outside the bounds of all things civilized, and who seeks to break conventions and take us into wild, untamed places. “I say to you: one must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.” Fredrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustrsa</p> 
        <p id="contentParagraph">Without chaos, society loses its culture, the system becomes flawed, stale and bureaucratic. Therefore, trickster not only destroys old values, but also creates new values. He reshapes the surrounding world with inner magic, continually weaving old into new. Apart from creation, trickster teaches us that we all have the capacity for destruction. Because trickster disrupts convention, he is commonly cast in a negative light. However, this is wrong, since he knows neither good nor evil, yet he is responsible for both. He has both a light side, and a dark side. Though, he always presents an element of playfulness. The trickster, in the form of the alchemical Mercurius, can be said to contain the totality of the psyche, both the unconscious and the conscious mind, the known and the unknown, and the light and dark within us all. The trickster is amoral.</p>
        <p id="contentParagraph">“A curious combination of typical trickster motifs can be found in the alchemical figure of Mercurius; for instance, his fondness for sly jokes and malicious pranks, his powers as a shape-shifter, his dual nature, half animal, half divine, his exposure to all kinds of tortures, and – last but not least – his approximation to the figure of a saviour.”
            Carl Jung, C.W. Vol.9 Part I: On The Psychology of the Trickster Figure</p><br><br>
