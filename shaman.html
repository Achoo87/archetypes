            <p id="contentParagraph">Jung says that the psyche constellates a psychopomp when ego has reached its limitations. The rigid grip of our ruling attitude falters, and although that may sound terrifying, it actually frees up psychic space for contents that can resource and guide us toward a path of growth.<br>These helping inner figures often appear during times of strife, hardship and flux, when we are being initiated into a new way of being. This change requires (symbolic) death — the archetypal realm of the psychopomp. Old structures must fall away; outdated behaviors and beliefs are left to wither and deteriorate, eventually producing the fertile ground for rebirth.</p>
            <p id="contentParagraph">“The psychopompos is this second figure; you can call it the daimon, or the shadow, or a god, or an ancestor spirit; it does not matter what name you give it, it is simply a figure; it might even be an animal. For in such a predicament we are dépossèdés [dispossessed], we lose the power of our ego, we lose our self-confidence. Until that moment, we were willful or arbitrary, we had made our own choice, we had found out a way, we had proceeded as far as this particular place. Then suddenly we are in an impasse, we lose faith in ourselves, and it is just as if all of our energy became regressive. And then our psyche reacts by constellating that double, which has the effect of leading us out of the situation.”<br>C.G. Jung, Visions: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1930–1934</p><br>
            <p id="contentParagraph">And so, when we are caught in the tides of life’s evolutions, we can look toward subtle, transitionary and in-between moments (like falling or awakening from sleep, getting lost in a day dream, etc) to discover the psychopomp’s presence and how it is shaping our journey.</p><br><br>
